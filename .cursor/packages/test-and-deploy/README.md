# Test and Deploy

## Workflow

When asked to deploy or ship changes:

1. **Commit changes** — Stage and commit all relevant changes with a clear, descriptive commit message
2. **Push to main** — Push the commit to the `main` branch on GitHub

Pushing to `main` will automatically trigger a Vercel deployment. No manual deployment steps are needed.
